### About me ✨

My name is SI SAID Wassim, am a 25 year old astrophysics ✨/fundamental physics student 👨‍🎓 with two masters degree, interested with computer science and data analysis/data mining and machine learning 💻.

### Points of intrest

Am interested in many aspects of Astrophysics ✨, as cosmology, galaxies, X-ray astronomy and Active Galactic Nuclei. I have done multipel internships in astrophysics such as searching for AGN condidates in CLoGS sample, and investigating protoclusters at cosmic noon in SPH cosmology simulations such as BAHAMAS/MACSIS at the Observatory of Paris.

I have conudcted data analysis of FENICS boards, Boards that are enduring quality tests to ensure their reliability at deployment on ATLAS experiement for the ATLAS High luminosity upgrade. I developed a Python library that collect, format, and analyse the data with a custom vizualisation filtring tool using HTML and JavaScript to monitor FENICS behaviours.

### What am curretly looking for 🔍

* Am looking currently for PhD. position to continue my research career👨‍🔬.

* Am also looking for a position as a R&D position in public/private laboratories/companies to contribute with my knowledge beyound my personal projects.
