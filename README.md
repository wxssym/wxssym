### About me ✨

My name is SI SAID Wassim, am a 25 year old astrophysics ✨/fundamental physics student 👨‍🎓 with two masters degree, interested with computer science and data analysis/data mining and machine learning 💻.

🌍 currently based in France with an Algerian citizenship.


### Points of intrest 💫
#### Academic/Scientific :
Am interested in many aspects of Astrophysics ✨, as cosmology, galaxies, X-ray astronomy and Active Galactic Nuclei. I have done multipel internships in astrophysics such as searching for AGN condidates in CLoGS sample, and investigating protoclusters at cosmic noon in SPH cosmology simulations such as BAHAMAS/MACSIS at the Observatory of Paris.

I have conducted data analysis of FENICS boards, Boards that are enduring quality tests to ensure their reliability at deployment on ATLAS experiement for the ATLAS High luminosity upgrade. I developed a Python library that collect, format, and analyse the data with a custom vizualisation filtring tool using HTML and JavaScript to monitor FENICS behaviours.

#### Hobby/Non academic :
* 🌐 Front/Backend Web developpement, Video games developpement, Web based applications .
* 🎵 Music : Electric/Acoustic guitar, Oud/Luth, Piano, Violin, Mandoline, Mandole, Bass, Banjo.
* 🎨 Digital drawing, 📸 Digital Photography

### My expertise 🧠
* Machine learning and data analysis for scientific usage and personal usage.
* Cosmology, Astronphysics, Astronomy notions.
* ATLAS experiement electronics, and particles physics notions.
* Read, use and understand X-ray observatories catalogs data.
* Solid comprehension of SPH simulations in cosmology.

### What am currently looking for 🔍

* Am looking currently for PhD. position to continue my research career👨‍🔬.
* Am also looking for a position as a R&D position in public/private laboratories/companies to contribute with my knowledge beyound my personal projects.
